    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

outputted as weapon grade fuel.

Virginia King, audio journal, June 4th 1941. 
Shortly after the outbreak of war in Europe, I was enlisted by the army to study the history of this valley. 
While the military is busy working on their research and development project,
 I’ve been studying the anthropological history of this hidden place. 
The little forest sprites seem to be the last living remnants of the long lost culture that once lived here. 
Were they domesticated? What role do they play in the ecosystem?  
A large number of them seem to inhabit the North-East sector of the valley, just past the ruins where the Lifeseed was found. 
That’s as good a place of any to study them.

repaying the debt of life owed back to the universe. Was that what they were doing here? A sacrificial 
restitution to the earth?

It seems the ancient tree doors operate through the fireflies that inhabit the nearby trees. When a tree

open the door for an indeterminable amount of time. The acorn doors operate similarly, as acorns 
grown from trees in the valley possess traces of amrita. What causes all the trees, coniferous and

The North-East dig site is providing a number of clues towards the stonecutting techniques of the

Virginia King, audio journal, June 4th 1941.
Shortly after the outbreak of war in Europe, &lt;until 12.548&gt;
I was enlisted by the army to study
the history of this valley. &lt;until 16.593&gt;
The mysterious forest sprites seem to be the last
living remnants of the long lost culture &lt;until 21.160&gt;
that once lived here.
A large number of them seem to inhabit &lt;until 25.260&gt;
the North-East sector of the valley,
just past the ruins where the Lifeseed, &lt;until 30.174&gt;
rumored to possess an
Earth-shattering power, was found. &lt;until 35.745&gt;
That’s as good a place of any to study them. &lt;until 38.784&gt;</value>
	</data>
	<data name="Intro_virginia_suit2_vo" xml:space="preserve">
		<value>The army calls this valley Area 634,
but I’ve ascribed a new word for it: &lt;until 7.059&gt;
Susurrus. &lt;until 9.225&gt;
The beauty of that word seems to rival
the majesty of this place. &lt;until 13.665&gt;
I suppose that would make its ancient 
inhabitants officially known as ‘Susurrians’! &lt;until 20.147&gt;
To think these ruins have existed here
for so long… &lt;until 23.955&gt;
they predate any known civilization
on the continent, &lt;until 27.874&gt;
They seem to have infused the life energy
from trees into their infrastructure, but how? &lt;until 33.974&gt;</value>
	</data>
	<data name="Intro_virginia_suit3_vo" xml:space="preserve">
		<value>Luckily for me, the military is
helping to explore all these ruins &lt;until 4.183&gt;
through the soldiers piloting L.E.A.F. suits.
They call these soldiers ‘Pathfinders’ &lt;until 8.623&gt;
as they can trek through terrain
normally inaccessible to someone like me. &lt;until 13.017&gt;
Every guy back home is going to want
to go joyriding in a L.E.A.F. suit; but until &lt;until 18.044&gt;
the military’s project comes to a close,
we’re cut off from any contact outside the valley. &lt;until 23.175&gt;
I guess the world will have to wait just
a bit longer to get their hands on these rides. &lt;until 27.660&gt;</value>

Since the production ramp up, only Pathfinders or approved personnel with emergency life extraction 
vests are allowed near the Astra facility. This kind of unstable technology is frightening. We’re putting 
a lot of faith in those scientists that they know what they’re doing. The fact we can barely keep up the

I can’t believe we’re the first squad to collect enough medallions to get inside this place! The Landsharks

We should make this pyramid our new base camp. This magical fires in here spook me a little though.

		<value>Note from Virginia King:

The sheer amount of effort the Sussurians put into constructing these architectural marvels is 
astonishing, it’s a bit hard to understand sometimes. They had clearly grasped forms of advanced 
mathematics to be able to construct such structures. How long did it take them? How large of a 
population was sustained here? It would have to be in the thousands.
</value>
	</data>
	<data name="lake_virginia_pyramid_tw" xml:space="preserve">
		<value>Note from Virginia King:

What purpose did this pyramid serve? The most likely answer is that it acted as a sacred altar. Sacrifice 
rituals may have been performed at the summit of the structure. I would love to get inside, but I’d 
rather not damage the pyramid by forcing a way in. I suppose I’ll wait on the Pathfinders, who seem to 
have made a competition out of it, to gather enough medallions. These guys make a competition out of 
everything.
</value>
	</data>
	<data name="lake_virginia_pyramid_vo" xml:space="preserve">
		<value>The pyramid built by the Susurrians served as
a ceremonial structure exalting the colossi. &lt;until 7.100&gt;
Along with the Titan Tree and daemons,
they intertwine to form a mythology. &lt;until 13.630&gt;
From what I gathered, &lt;until 15.085&gt;
the colossi were once humans
who feasted upon the forbidden fruit, &lt;until 19.220&gt;
corrupting them into giant monstrosities- &lt;until 22.520&gt;
cannibalizing their fellow man
and devouring all life within the valley. &lt;until 28.020&gt;
Is this a tale of caution? &lt;until 30.550&gt;

against abusing the power of the Lifeseed? &lt;until 34.700&gt;</value>

		<value>While it’s no surprise that Sussurian lore
revolves around the fruit of a sacred tree, &lt;until 5.760&gt;
a common trope in mythologies, I’m most
surprised by how the daemons fit into the lore- &lt;until 12.618&gt;
apparently considered wardens of the valley, &lt;until 15.440&gt;
charged with returning stolen
life back to the valley. &lt;until 18.872&gt;
That’s a pretty great burden for such little guys. &lt;until 22.590&gt;</value>

	<data name="lake_virginia_wendigo_tw" xml:space="preserve">
		<value>Note from Virginia King:

Wendigo mythology is utterly fascinating. Not only do they reflect famine and harsh winters, but also 
greed and gluttony. Sometimes, even humans overcome with greed could turn into a wendigo, doomed 
to feast upon the flesh of man for the rest of their lives, never feeling satiated.

Sometimes they are depicted as ever-growing as they consume more and more flesh. Uhhh... will I sleep
tonight? Just a myth Virginia, just a myth…

It’s odd to think about what exactly a life is once you’ve experienced quantum death. What exactly are 
the ingredients that make up my life? My ingredients aren’t really any different than anyone else’s; 
carbon, calcium, hydrogen, etc. held together with some energy. So what exactly makes me, me? 

I guess, if anything, I’m just a pattern. One that forms out of the chaotic blender of matter in the 
universe, like a whirlpool out of the water, and when I die that pattern simply dissipates back into the 
cosmos. Are we all the same universe simply expressing itself?

		<value>Note from a researcher:

Quantum death and immortality using L.E.A.F. technology is a fascinating field of study. Using this tech, 
a person could live out a full life without fear of an accident cutting it short. Albeit, the use of 
‘immortality’ is a misnomer, as the user simply shifts to a new timeline wherein they are still alive, this 
can only hold true until all practical timelines are exhausted. 

For example, an elderly man dying of natural causes is unlikely to shift into a timeline where they do not 
die as that parallel world is very unlikely to exist.

		<value>Note from a researcher:

The L.E.A.F. suit may prove to be the pinnacle feat of Pendulum; the ability to manipulate life and death 
using the God Hand, the agility, and the ability to circumvent death, all thanks to the amrita energy 
converted from this valley’s orbs.

Depending on the degree of magnitude, certain organisms provide very little amrita energy 
when targeted by the L.E.A.F. suit’s God Hand. Smaller organisms such as insects, grass, flowers

		<value>Note from a researcher:

The Lifeseed’s ability to amplify energy is incredibly dangerous. If energy passes through too 
quickly, it will amplify at an exponential rate uncontainable by our conductors and thermal chemical 
reserves. To ensure we do not blow out the energy circuit, we must mitigate a restricted amount of 
amrita to pass through at any given time. Typically, only one pass-through is all that the conductors 
can handle before the energy becomes too immense to possibly contain, reaching upwards of a full 
petajoule.
